# Panto Furniture Landing Page

This is a practice project inspired from a Figma community design.  
I created this to improve my HTML, CSS, JavaScript and responsive web design skills.  
This project is only for learning purpose and not for commercial use.

## Technologies Used:
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript  
- Bootstrap (if used)  
- WOW.js (for animation)  

## Purpose:
To practice frontend development and convert Figma design into real working website.
